1. I learned how to efficiently implement a simple hash table in Java
2. I had run into a few challenges ensuring that the key and values were paired. I was confused on the code and
how to implement it
3. If I had more time I would try to get the hash table to allow for dynamic sizing. In my case, it is a fixed
table
4. Hash tables are very important in the real world and can be applied in almost any industry, for example, they are used in databases, cookies, and setting up password encryption
